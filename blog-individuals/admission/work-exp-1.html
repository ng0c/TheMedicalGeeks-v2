                        <p> <strong>A degree in medicine</strong> is one of the <strong>most competitive
                                degrees</strong> in the UK. Therefore, just being
                            good at school and achieving high grades is <strong>usually not enough</strong> for a
                            successful application.
                            Other <strong>extra- and super-curricular activities</strong> need to be undertaken to
                            enhance your
                            portfolio.
                            <br>
                            <br>

                            <strong>Work experience</strong> is one of the <strong>most important aspects</strong> of
                            your application. It shows that you
                            have been <strong>exposed to healthcare settings</strong> and you have an idea of what being
                            a doctor
                            involves. In addition, work experience is also a <strong>great opportunity</strong> to
                            reflect and learn
                            about something <strong>specific to medicine</strong> in case you are asked about that in
                            your interview.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            The vast majority of universities will require you to have <strong>done some work
                                experience.</strong> Some
                            may have <strong>minimum requirements,</strong> others may not. Either way, the single most
                            important thing
                            when it comes to work experience is <strong>what you have learned from it,</strong> rather
                            than how much you
                            have done.
                            <br>
                            <br>

                            <strong>Therefore, don’t be disheartened</strong> if you couldn’t get the amount of weeks
                            that you wanted.
                            Getting work experience in the UK is <strong>generally very difficult.</strong> With the
                            outbreak of the
                            Coronavirus, this is <strong>even more difficult now.</strong> As long as you meet your
                            universities’
                            requirements, and if you have taken away something meaningful from your work experience, you
                            <strong>should be in the safe zone.</strong>

                            <strong>There are many ways</strong> through which you can <strong>arrange work experience.
                            </strong>The most common way is by
                            <strong>contacting the place</strong> you’re interested in <strong> <a
                                    href="work-exp-2.html">via phone</a> or <a

                            <br>

                            then for you and
                            others to make good use of. For example, if your <strong>sixth form/college</strong> hosted
                            a talk by a
                            doctor/healthcare worker, you can always <strong>go up to them after the talk</strong> and
                            directly ask them.

                            preference for one over the other, by all means go for that preference. Moreover, if you’re
                            unsure about which one then <strong>we suggest you follow the guidance below.</strong>

                                surgery</strong> or a
                            <strong>care home,</strong> it is
                            recommended to use the <strong>phone.</strong> This is because smaller institutions are more
                            likely to pick
                            up the phone than larger and busier ones. Smaller institutions may also not be very active
                            on the email front.</ul>

                        <ul>🏥 For the reason mentioned in the previous paragraph, if you are applying to a
                            <strong>large
                                institution</strong> such as a <strong>hospital</strong> then using the
                            <strong>email</strong> is more likely to work than using the
                            phone. Plus some large hospitals may have a <strong>specific team </strong>whose
                            responsibility is handling
                            work experience for <strong>aspiring medics and medical students.</strong></ul>

                            moment. Look at the
                            <strong>list of consultants</strong> of that speciality. Choose any consultant. <strong>Read
                                their profile.</strong>

                            <br>
                            Usually, in the consultants’ profiles you will find some information about their

                                interests.</strong> If a research interest of a specific consultant sounds interesting

                                great!</strong> Look it up for more details. Learn more about it and potentially
                            <strong>read that
                                consultant’s research publications if they’re available.</strong>

                            free.
                            <br>
                            <br>

                        <ul>⚡⚡ For example, let’s assume that a <strong>cardiologist’s area of research</strong>
                            interests is on the
                            effect
                            of <strong>beta-blockers on blood pressure in diabetic people.</strong> Look up what
                            beta-blockers are, what
                            do they do? A little bit about their history. <strong>Any side effects? </strong>Etc. Then
                            find out about
                            their effect on blood pressure and what other things affect blood pressure. Then, do some
                            research on the <strong>heart,</strong> its basic structure and the effect of beta-blockers
                            on the heart.
                            Then research more about diabetes and the effect that has on blood pressure as well.</ul>
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        <ul>⚡⚡ After you do your research, <strong>contact that consultant</strong> via email or phone.
                            In this particular
                            case because consultants are usually busy, we recommend <strong>using the email</strong> so
                            that they can
                            read your email whenever they want to. If you contact a consultant by phone and they have
                            ward rounds and meetings to go through, <strong>they’re a lot more likely to turn you
                                down.</strong></ul>
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        In your email say that you are interested in their area of research. Talk about the
                        <strong>research
                            that you have done about that area.</strong> Then say that you would like to shadow them for
                        a few
                        days to <strong>learn more about their speciality</strong> and their lives within that
                        speciality, and to
                        <strong>learn more about their research.</strong>
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        That way, the doctor is a <strong>lot more likely to accept your request </strong>to shadow
                        him/her as they
                        see that you are <strong>genuinely interested</strong> in their field and that you have done
                        some background
                        research to prove it.

                        <br>
                        <ul>✅ If you are interested in <strong>shadowing a GP,</strong> it has to be a <strong>different
                                GP</strong> to the one that you’re
                            <strong>registered to.</strong></ul>
                        <br>
                        <ul>✅ Healthcare institutions are <strong>very busy workplaces</strong> and they are likely to
                            have very tight
                            schedules. Your calendar needs to be <strong>very flexible</strong> when it comes to looking
                            for placements.
                            Unless, you have an important exam or if you have already booked a family holiday, you
                            should probably <strong>prioritise work experience over anything else.</strong></ul>
                        <br>

                        <ul>✅ There are certain <strong>vaccinations and health precautions</strong> that you will need
                            to
                            have before you
                            apply for your work experience. If you are unsure about this aspect of applying for work
                            experience, <strong>visit the Occupational Health department’s website</strong> of the
                            institution you are

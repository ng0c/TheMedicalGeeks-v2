                        <p>The UCAT is an admissions test used by many universities as part of the admissions process
                            into medicine, veterinary sciences and dentistry. This generally allows a candidate to
                            progress into the interview stage if the university deems the candidate as a potential
                            medical student.</p>

                    <div class="text-details">
                        <p>The UCAT is composed of five sections: verbal reasoning, decision making, quantitative
                            reasoning, abstract reasoning and situational judgement.
                        </p>
                        <p1><strong>Verbal reasoning </strong>is made up of 11 passages, each passage is made up of 4
                            questions, totalling 44 questions. 22 minutes are given to complete this question which
                            leaves 30 seconds per question. Verbal reasoning is scored between 300-900. The average
                            score for 2019 applicants was 565. This section aims to test your ability to obtain
                            information from long, and difficult text passages.
                        </p1>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <p1><strong>Decision Making </strong>questions have a few types. Overall the types of decision
                            making questions make up 29 questions. 32 minutes is given to complete this section, leaving
                            just over a minute for each question. Decision making is also scored between 300-900. The
                            average score for 2019 applicants was 618. This section tests your ability to follow logical
                            information to reach a conclusion.

                        </p1>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <p1><strong>Quantitative reasoning </strong>is a section of mathematics. It is made up of 36
                            questions. You are given 25 minutes to complete this section, this leaves roughly 40-50
                            seconds per question. This section is scored between 300-900. The average score for
                            quantitative reasoning in 2019 was 662. This section tests your ability to carry out
                            mathematical calculations under pressure.

                        </p1>

                        <br>
                        <p1><strong>Abstract reasoning </strong>has four types of questions. These four types of
                            questions total 55 questions. You are given 14 minutes to finish these questions. Abstract
                            reasoning is scored between 300-900. The average score for 2019 applicants was 638. This
                            section tests your ability to identify patterns of given shapes.

                        <br>
                        <p1><strong>Situational judgement </strong>is similar to verbal reasoning as it is also made up
                            of passages. Each passage contains many questions. Overall there are 69 questions amongst
                            all the passages. You are given 27 minutes to complete the situational judgement section.
                            This leaves about 20-25 seconds per question. This section is scored in bands between band
                            1-4 where band 1 is the highest and band 4 is the lowest. The average score for applicants
                            is usually band 2. This section tests your understanding of the ethical and professional

                            than those who take it towards the end of the summer holiday. However, different applicants
                            may have different circumstances that means they take the UCAT at different times of the
                            test window, but it is generally recommended that you take it near the beginning of the
                            summer.

                            your peak experience by the test date. Spending too much time revising for it, however, is
                            also risky because you may surpass your peak point and your performance may start declining.

                    <div class="text-details">
                        <p>UCAT is one aspect of many that universities look at when deciding whether to invite a
                            candidate for an interview or to make him/her an offer. Of course there are a lot of
                            variables that affect the likelihood of success when applying to medicine. However, an
                            application is more likely to be successful if UCAT score is higher than average. The higher
                            the score the higher the likelihood of successful application. This trend is particularly
                            true for universities that do not require A-level Biology,as they try and compensate for
                            this by looking out for higher UCAT scores.

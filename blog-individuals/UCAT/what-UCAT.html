                    </div>
                    <div class="text-details">
                        <p>The UCAT is composed of five sections: verbal reasoning, decision making,
                            quantitative
                            reasoning, abstract reasoning and situational judgement.
                        </p>
                        <p1><strong>Verbal reasoning </strong>is made up of 11 passages, each passage is made up
                            of 4
                            questions, totalling 44 questions. 22 minutes are given to complete this question
                            which
                            leaves 30 seconds per question. Verbal reasoning is scored between 300-900. The
                            average
                            score for 2019 applicants was 565. This section aims to test your ability to obtain
                            information from long, and difficult text passages.
                        </p1>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <p1><strong>Decision Making </strong>questions have a few types. Overall the types of
                            decision
                            making questions make up 29 questions. 32 minutes is given to complete this section,
                            leaving
                            just over a minute for each question. Decision making is also scored between
                            300-900. The
                            average score for 2019 applicants was 618. This section tests your ability to follow
                            logical
                            information to reach a conclusion.

                        <br>
                        <p1><strong>Quantitative reasoning </strong>is a section of mathematics. It is made up
                            of 36
                            questions. You are given 25 minutes to complete this section, this leaves roughly
                            40-50
                            seconds per question. This section is scored between 300-900. The average score for
                            quantitative reasoning in 2019 was 662. This section tests your ability to carry out
                            mathematical calculations under pressure.

                        </p1>

                        <br>
                        <p1><strong>Abstract reasoning </strong>has four types of questions. These four types of
                            questions total 55 questions. You are given 14 minutes to finish these questions.
                            Abstract
                            reasoning is scored between 300-900. The average score for 2019 applicants was 638.
                            This
                            section tests your ability to identify patterns of given shapes.

                        <br>
                        <p1><strong>Situational judgement </strong>is similar to verbal reasoning as it is also
                            made up
                            of passages. Each passage contains many questions. Overall there are 69 questions
                            amongst
                            all the passages. You are given 27 minutes to complete the situational judgement
                            section.
                            This leaves about 20-25 seconds per question. This section is scored in bands
                            between band
                            1-4 where band 1 is the highest and band 4 is the lowest. The average score for
                            applicants
                            is usually band 2. This section tests your understanding of the ethical and
                            professional
                            aspect of being a doctor.

                    <div class="text-details">
                        <p>You can usually take the UCAT anywhere between July and early October. Moreover, some
                            studies
                            show that students who take the UCAT earlier in the summer tend to score higher on
                            average
                            than those who take it towards the end of the summer holiday. However, different
                            applicants
                            may have different circumstances that means they take the UCAT at different times of
                            the
                            test window, but it is generally recommended that you take it near the beginning of
                            the
                            summer.

                    <div class="text-details">
                        <p>You can usually take the UCAT anywhere between July and early October. Moreover, some
                            studies
                            show that students who take the UCAT earlier in the summer tend to score higher on
                            average
                            than those who take it towards the end of the summer holiday. However, different
                            applicants
                            may have different circumstances that means they take the UCAT at different times of
                            the
                            test window, but it is generally recommended that you take it near the beginning of
                            the
                            summer.

                        <p>It is usually recommended that you spend two to three hours a day for two to three
                            weeks
                            prior to your test date. Spending less time is risky given that you may not have
                            reached
                            your peak experience by the test date. Spending too much time revising for it,
                            however, is
                            also risky because you may surpass your peak point and your performance may start
                            declining.

                    <div class="text-details">
                        <p>UCAT is one aspect of many that universities look at when deciding whether to invite
                            a
                            candidate for an interview or to make him/her an offer. Of course there are a lot of
                            variables that affect the likelihood of success when applying to medicine. However,
                            an
                            application is more likely to be successful if UCAT score is higher than average.
                            The higher
                            the score the higher the likelihood of successful application. This trend is
                            particularly
                            true for universities that do not require A-level Biology,as they try and compensate
                            for
                            this by looking out for higher UCAT scores.

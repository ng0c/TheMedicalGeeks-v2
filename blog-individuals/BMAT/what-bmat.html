                        <p> <strong>The BMAT is an admissions test that aims to assess your aptitude. The BMAT is used
                                in the UK and many other countries. Medicine, Dentistry and Biomedical Sciences are the
                                main courses that require the BMAT. This test is administered by Cambridge Assessment
                                Admissions Testing. The BMAT allows universities to decide if a certain candidate is to
                                be deemed to be invited for an interview, or potentially to be offered a place.

                            <br>
                            <br>
                            This section focuses on your ability to process relatively difficult data and information
                            quick enough under time pressure. The nature of the questions in section 1 is mixed but they
                            all focus on testing certain skills. For example, understanding different arguments, problem
                            solving skills, data analysis skills; understanding implication and inference statements.
                            <br>
                            <br>

                            You are given 60 minutes to complete section 1. There are 35 multiple choice questions in
                            section 1. This means you have about 1 minute 40 seconds per question. Even though this may
                            seem like a long time, however, it is extremely time-pressured as some of the questions will
                            be particularly difficult. This section is scored on a scale from 1 to 9 where 9 is the
                            highest. Usually a score of 5 or more means that you are in the safer zone. Moreover, this
                            depends and changes on a yearly basis. The average score for 2019 BMAT applicants was 4.

                            <br>
                            <br>

                            <strong>Quick tip:</strong> when a question is too difficult you will know that as you may
                            have spent more
                            than a minute but still no improvement on that question. We recommend that you move on to
                            the next one and come back to this at the end if you have time left. You could easily spend
                            more than 3 minutes on one question and not get anywhere. Even if you got the answer, at
                            some point spending too long on a question isn’t worth the 1 point.

                            This section tests your scientific and mathematical knowledge. It relies on the science and
                            maths specifications of GCSE level, slightly stretched. It is true that knowing your GCSE
                            science and maths is enough to do well in section 2. However, you will also need to do
                            practice questions as you need to familiarise yourself with the nature of these questions.
                            Especially that BMAT section 2 questions are more focused on applying these principles that
                            you’ve learnt in school rather than memorising them.

                            <br>
                            <br>

                            You can have a look at the <strong><a

                            <br>
                            <br>
                            You will be given 30 minutes to complete 27 questions. This leaves just under a minute per
                            question. Usually, with enough practice and if you are really focused you will be able to
                            finish these questions in time. Section 2 in the BMAT is graded in the same way as section
                            1, 1-9. Once again, scoring a 5 will put you in a relatively comfortable place. The average
                            score for the 2019 BMAT cohort in section 2 was also 4.

                            This is an essay task. You will have to write an essay in 30 minutes. You will have to
                            choose one essay title out of three and write about it. Your writing does not have to be the
                            fanciest of writings to achieve a good score. All you have to do is write clearly,
                            coherently, and concisely. In addition, your ideas and thoughts must be organised and backed
                            by evidence where needed.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            The BMAT essay has a double score: score for your written English; score for your quality of
                            content. Your written English score is A, C or E, where A is the best mark. Normally a
                            coherently written essay with good use of grammar, punctuation and vocabulary would get you
                            an A score. Quality of content is based on how you answer the question. Quality of content
                            is scored on a scale from 1-5. A clear essay that directly addresses all points of the
                            question with no weakness can get you a 4 score, or maybe 5. The final essay score would be
                            a number next to a letter, 4A for example. The 2019 cohort section 3 average was A for
                            written English and 3 for quality of content.

                            <strong>Top tip:</strong> make sure you spend enough time planning your essay before you
                            start writing. The
                            clearer your plan the cleaner your essay will be and the more organised your thoughts will
                            be. You only get one A4 side to write your essay. You are not allowed any extra paper. (You
                            can write your plan on the question paper). If you do not plan your essay well enough you
                            will end up scribbling all over your paper. This will make it a lot harder for the examiner
                            to examine which can negatively affect your mark.

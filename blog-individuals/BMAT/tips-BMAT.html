                        <p> Much like in the UCAT, timing in the BMAT is very important. We explain in our
                            <strong><a href="what-bmat.html">Introduction to BMAT blog</a> </strong>the timing of the
                            BMAT in
                            much more detail. <br> <br>But in conclusion, 1 minute 40 seconds may seem long enough
                            time per
                            question in section 1. However, the level of difficulty of this section makes it
                            challenging to finish all 35 questions in time. The fact that you are more familiar with
                            section 2 also means that questions in this section will be more nuanced and confusing.
                            Finally, planning is vital for section 3. More on that later…
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Here we offer you some tips on how to <strong>save time.</strong> Please note that the two
                            timing tips shared
                            below are more applicable to multiple choice questions in sections 1 and 2. However, we have
                            more tips for section 3 towards the end.

                            <strong>Mental maths.</strong> Make sure you take the necessary steps to improve your mental
                            arithmetic
                            skills. The more practice you do the better. Being able to do quick maths in your head
                            during the BMAT will save you precious seconds during the test. This applies for sections 1
                            and 2. Especially section 2 where a good set of arithmetic skills will be useful for maths,
                            physics and chemistry questions. You are not allowed a calculator during the exam. This
                            means the alternative would be to use pen and paper to calculate your answers which is
                            incredibly inefficient.

                            <strong>TheMedicalGeeks top tip to improve, is to do maths when you're out and about. When
                                your
                                ordering your next coffee, why don't you try adding different coffees together with all
                                the
                                extras. You don't need to order it unless you want a super rush and want to bounce
                                around
                                the room!!</strong>

                            <strong>Guessing!</strong> Be sure that if you had to guess - and given the nature of BMAT
                            questions
                            you probably will have to - then make an educated guess. The best way to make an
                            educated guess is by eliminating the obviously wrong answers. This will instantly
                            increase your chances of guessing the right answer.
                            </strong>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            However, it is not always possible to make an educated guess. In this case, you just have to
                            guess anything. We recommend that you stay consistent with the option you guess if you are
                            equally unsure about all options. For example, if you choose B for all the questions that
                            you are unsure about, you are more likely to get at least one question right than if you
                            have chosen random options. One mark on your BMAT score can make a difference.

                            There are two unique advantages to BMAT section 2 that makes it more predictable than other
                            sections. Firstly, you are already aware of the content. Secondly, we have access to an
                            official syllabus. This syllabus can be found online. We recommend that you go through this
                            syllabus a few times and make sure that you are aware of all bullet points covered.

                            <br>
                            <br>

                            One way to take your section 2 preparation to the next level is by doing GCSE past papers
                            for section 2 subjects. This is probably not something you particularly want to do but many
                            students have reported finding this helpful. Especially GCSE maths, chemistry and physics
                            past papers. Though don’t stress much about this. This is only to be tried if you have
                            enough time.

                                minutes to write your essay. Do not be afraid to spend up to 15 minutes planning your
                                essay if you feel that you need to. Having a well planned and structured essay is better
                                than the alternative. A solid and well thought plan is the key to this kind of essay.
                                Indeed, the whole essay is a single side of A4 which can be written in 15-20 minutes if
                                you have a good, clear plan and have done enough practice. You can use the question
                                paper to plan out your essay.

                            <p>One of the main criteria for the Quality of Content mark for the essay is how clear your
                                essay is. This means how concise it is; how much it answers the question and how
                                off-the-point is your answer. The more precise your essay is, the
                                better
                                your score will be. This can all be the result of well planned essays and enough

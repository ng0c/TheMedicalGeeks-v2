                        <p> There are certain attributes that are assumed to be acquired by a physician, or an aspiring
                            medical student. These include but are not limited to: <strong>leadership, resilience,
                                emotional
                                intelligence, discipline, team members, extracurricular activities</strong> (where
                            possible),
                            <strong>academic involvement, empathy, communication skills, motivation and
                                problem-solving.</strong> Of
                            course, it is almost impossible to include all of these in 4000 characters! However, make
                            sure you have a few down. You may have the opportunity to show off (some of) the rest during
                            your interview. Read the last tip for directions on where to learn more about these

                        <h1>Make It Interesting!
                        </h1>

                        <p>
                            There are two ways to make a piece of writing interesting. Writing about interesting events;
                            writing in an interesting way.
                            <br>
                            <br>

                            The former is probably not possible. Simply because the admissions staff reading your
                            personal statement has probably read thousands of personal statements before. Plus, you may
                            have had the chance to do interesting things that other students did not have the chance to
                            do. This could make the admissions staff reluctant to be impressed by what countries you
                            travelled to or how many hospital placements you’ve been to abroad.
                            <br>
                            <br>

                            The latter way is usually the more efficient one. This is basically based on writing in a
                            way that grabs the attention of the reader. You don’t have to be a novelist for this, just
                            follow certain steps. For example, avoid being descriptive and try to be more reflective.
                            Write how certain events made you feel. Write about moments that made you question a belief
                            or thought you have always held etc. For example, “I found the GP’s empathy striking. The
                            fact that the patient feels like there is someone who listens to them and understands their
                            pain makes me feel that the GP’s empathy is part of the treatment”.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <i>Remember: it’s all about what you learnt from doing something, rather than doing the
                                thing
                                itself. For example, an honest reflection of your 2-day GP placement is likely to be
                                more
                                impressive than a mere description of your 3-week hospital placement in South
                                Africa.</i>

                            <p>This is straightforward. Never think that it is enough to make a claim just to impress
                                the reader. Always back it up with an event or an experience that demonstrates what
                                you’re claiming. For example, don't write,<i>“I have the qualities of a leader”.
                                </i>But instead
                                write,
                                <i>“I use my leadership skills to manage my local cricket team. My duties include
                                    organising events and ensuring the wellbeing of the players.”.</i>

                                <br>
                                The lack of evidence may either make your statement go unnoticed. Or, even worse, some
                                admissions staff may be annoyed by too much lack of evidence!

                            <p>This may seem too obvious since it is called ‘personal statement’, however, a lot of
                                students forget the personal aspect. Some applicants may be too keen to include generic
                                qualities and stories that they have heard of. Whilst this may work for some people, it
                                certainly won’t work for most. The best way to impress the reader of your personal
                                statement is by making it specific to you. Talk about your life experience, your
                                stories, your qualities.

                                reading your
                                statement, ask yourself: will you impress a first date if they read it? If so then
                                you’re not in a bad place. However, please remember that this is one aspect of the
                                personal statement only, qualities and attributes. I.e. a first date might not even care
                                about academia. So using this trick is potentially counterproductive for Oxbridge
                                applicants.

                                This does not mean memorise your statement off by heart but just be aware of the things

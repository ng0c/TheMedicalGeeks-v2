                    <div class="text">
                        <p> The hardest part of planning your personal statement is actually choosing your subject! Even
                            though your personal statement is meant to be an introductory document into who you are, it
                            always helps to show that you have the skills for the course you applied for. The key here
                            is making your statement tailored and specific so that it truly describes you. <br> <br>
                            Writing a
                            personal statement about medicine is the first part of this specificity. Next, choose what
                            universities you will be applying to. A personal statement that is great for Newcastle
                            University may not be appreciated as much at Oxford University. This is because different
                            universities look for different things in their applicants' personal statement. Of course,
                            you will be applying for a few universities. Therefore, the solution here is a compromise
                            that makes your personal statement a suitable match for all of your choices.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <strong>Top tip:</strong> don’t name any specific university in your statement. This is to
                            avoid any
                            potential embarrassment. For example, if you name University A, you might get an awkward
                            question in your University B’s interview on why you haven’t named them! Or why are you
                            applying to B if you want A! This also makes other universities hesitant to invite you for
                            an interview.

                        <p>You should start thinking about your personal statement at the beginning of A-levels if not
                            before. Make sure that you have evidence or certificates of all the extra things that you
                            say you have done. Did you do that one day course thats related to improving your team work?
                            Add it in. <br> <br>A week before you write your personal statement should be enough time to
                            spend on
                            planning it. This is assuming that you had thought about writing your personal statement in

                            and will make you stand out. You can also think of any events that you attended which made
                            you want to study medicine.

                    <div class="text-details">
                        <p>When it comes to writing your personal statement you will most definitely need a draft to
                            start with. You will make tons of changes if not more to that initial draft, so don’t worry
                            too much about how much editing you do. For the sake of making your statement personal and
                            grabbing the attention of the reader: start off with the reason you want to study medicine;
                            end it with why you think that you are a good applicant and why the university should make
                            you an offer. Make sure these two paragraphs in particular are as coherent and well-written
                            as they can be. (of course, you don’t have to follow this rule, but, this is our
                            recommendation). <strong>FIRST IMPRESSIONS ARE VITAL!</strong>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Paragraphs in the middle should show your interest in the course and discuss your
                            attributes: skills that you have; awards that you won; books/journals that interest you etc.
                            Make sure that you back up with evidence when you make a statement.
                            <br>
                            <br>

                            For example, don’t just say that you’re a good leader - explain a situation where you’ve had
                            to use your leadership skills and where others have benefitted from your experience/skills.
                            DoFE is perfect but not everyone does this. Group work at school is perfect, or any
                            extracurricular that you did, that involved: <strong>1)</strong> A team <strong>2)</strong>
                            A common goal <strong>3)</strong> You
                            delegating/assigning roles, is perfect to add.

                        <p>We believe that staying focused and concise, whilst describing you at your best will probably
                            be the most challenging part. However, you still always have to consider the word limit.
                            Moreover, don’t think about the word limit when writing your draft. Only when editing your
                            personal statement, remember that it has to be a <strong>maximum of 4000 characters.

                            At TheMedicalGeeks we understand how difficult writing a personal statement can be,
                            especially if this is your first time doing such a thing. This is why we provide a brilliant
                            personal statement service where we offer you multiple feedback, on your personal statement,
                            by medical students. <a href="../../personal-statement.html"><strong>Find out more

                    <p>How important is my medicine personal statement? Do universities read my personal statement? What
                        are red flags for university personal statements? What makes a good personal statement? <br><br>
                        <i><strong>First of all let’s establish something.</strong> Medicine is different to other
                            courses. If you are
                            applying for medicine, universities will most definitely read your personal statement.* This
                            is unlike some courses where not much weight is given to the personal statement. Now that
                            this is established, the difference is in the way different medical schools use your
                            personal statements.
                            <br>
                            <br>

                            * Very important note: Brighton And sussex is the only medical school that does not use the
                            personal statement at any stage in the application process, for UK applicants.
                        </i>
                    </p>

                </div>
                <div class="main-body-text">
                    <div class="individual-headings">

                        <h1>How Important Is Your Personal Statement?</h1>
                    </div>
                    <div class="text">
                        <p> The true answer for this question is that it depends on the university you are applying
                            for.
                            <br>
                            <br>

                            Some universities use personal statements purely to look for evidence for your enthusiasm to
                            study medicine and your understanding of the role of a doctor. This is where the
                            medicine-related extracurricular activities and volunteering helps. For example, Birmingham
                            University looks for evidence that you have done extracurricular activities and have had an
                            exposure to healthcare settings. <strong>In other words as an example, </strong>things that
                            Birmingham look for would be
                            sports that you do in your free time, work experience and volunteering that you have
                            done.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Other universities look for evidence of other things in your personal statement. For
                            example, Oxford and Cambridge focus heavily on academia and academic achievements in your
                            personal statement, compared to other universities that focus less on the academic aspects
                            and more on certain personal attributes, such as Lancaster University.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <i>As mentioned above, Brighton & Sussex Medical School do not use personal statements at
                                any
                                point throughout the application process for UK applicants.</i>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Some universities choose to quantify your personal statement and give it a score. For
                            example, Nottingham University Medical School gives it a maximum of 16 points. The ‘points’
                            system is more common in universities where all aspects of the application are quantified to
                            make it more possible to determine candidates to be invited for an interview
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            In some universities, the importance of a personal statement changes from one candidate to
                            another. For example, Oxford University Medical School mainly uses GCSE grades and BMAT
                            scores to invite candidates to interview. Nevertheless, if one of these two things isn’t as
                            high as the Oxford standard then the applicant’s personal statement will be of increased
                            importance. The reason for this is that admission staff will look for any extenuating
                            circumstances that may have put the applicant at a disadvantage.
                            It is, therefore, important to talk about any extenuating circumstances in your personal
                            statement.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            There is a huge variety in how different universities use your personal statement. As you
                            can see above, each university is different. We, therefore, highly advise that you visit the
                            universities’ you are thinking of websites to learn more about how they use personal
                            statements.

                            Overall, we can split the personal statement into two parts: written English and quality of
                            content. (Have you seen this classification somewhere?!). Therefore a good personal
                            statement is one that covers both aspects coherently.
                            <br>
                            <br>


                            To cover your written English coherently you need to focus on your spelling, punctuation and
                            grammar. Using sophisticated terminology also helps. Though don’t overuse this! Basically
                            tips that apply to good English in normal essay writing also apply here.

                            <br>
                            <br>

                            To cover your quality of content coherently is the part of your personal statement where you
                            need to be specific. For example, specificity about the sort of work experience that you did
                            and what that taught you. You have an opportunity here to make your personal statement
                            tailored for certain universities you have applied to.
                            <br>
                            <br>


                            For example, looking at the information above. Lancaster University look for personal
                            attributes. Therefore, you can cover your personal attributes in this section.
                            <br>
                            <br>

                            You can write something like, “When I was shadowing my local GP I noticed the vital
                            importance of communication between healthcare staff. The GP’s language was noticeably
                            different when he talked to the surgeon compared to when he talked to his patient”.

                        <p>You should start thinking about your personal statement at the beginning of A-levels if not
                            before. Make sure that you have evidence or certificates of all the extra things that you
                            say you have done. Did you do that one day course thats related to improving your team work?
                            Add it in. <br> <br>A week before you write your personal statement should be enough time to

                        <p>When it comes to writing your personal statement you will most definitely need a draft to
                            start with. You will make tons of changes if not more to that initial draft, so don’t worry
                            too much about how much editing you do. For the sake of making your statement personal and
                            grabbing the attention of the reader: start off with the reason you want to study medicine;
                            end it with why you think that you are a good applicant and why the university should make
                            you an offer. Make sure these two paragraphs in particular are as coherent and well-written
                            as they can be. (of course, you don’t have to follow this rule, but, this is our
                            recommendation). <strong>FIRST IMPRESSIONS ARE VITAL!</strong>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Paragraphs in the middle should show your interest in the course and discuss your
                            attributes: skills that you have; awards that you won; books/journals that interest you etc.
                            Make sure that you back up with evidence when you make a statement.
                            <br>
                            <br>

                            For example, don’t just say that you’re a good leader - explain a situation where you’ve had
                            to use your leadership skills and where others have benefitted from your experience/skills.
                            DoFE is perfect but not everyone does this. Group work at school is perfect, or any
                            extracurricular that you did, that involved: <strong>1)</strong> A team <strong>2)</strong>
                            A common goal <strong>3)</strong> You
                            delegating/assigning roles, is perfect to add.

                        <p>We believe that staying focused and concise, whilst describing you at your best will probably
                            be the most challenging part. However, you still always have to consider the word limit.
                            Moreover, don’t think about the word limit when writing your draft. Only when editing your
                            personal statement, remember that it has to be a <strong>maximum of 4000 characters.

                            At TheMedicalGeeks we understand how difficult writing a personal statement can be,

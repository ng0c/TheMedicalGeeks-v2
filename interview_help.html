    <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
  </div>

  <button class="accordion">I haven't received my interview guide</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>Make sure you check your Spam folder and your All Inbox too! If you still can't find it, contact us
      themedicalgeeks@gmail.com and we'll send a copy to you directly.</p>
  </div>

  <button class="accordion">Who are the interviewers?</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>For your mock interview service, you will always have medical students. The majority of the interviews will be
      done by the co-founders Ryan and Sam, however there may be the occasion where our Product Manager Makeen will step
      in!</p>
  </div>

  <button class="accordion">What happens if my internet is really bad?</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>We understand that some applicants live in really rural areas and the internet can be bad. If you arrive on time
      to the appointment allocated to you, and the internet is affecting the quality of the interview, we may offer a
      refund to you.
      We advise that you try and find locations with stable internet access. Simple tricks such as doing the mock
      interview closer to your WiFi router will improve connection, or arranging an interview during your school time,
      so you will have a stable connection at school. Public libraries are also very good locations to do interviews
      too.</p>
  </div>

  <button class="accordion">When Should I Book An Interview Mock Service?</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>From our experience, we recommend doing the 1st mock interview session 2 weeks away from your interview. Then 1
      week away from your interview, have the 2nd session.
      This allows you to have time to change and make any corrections from the 1st practice session and theres enough
      time from the 2nd session to make sure you're ready for the big day.</p>
  </div>

  <button class="accordion">How long are each sessions?</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>Each session is 1 hour long. We cover a range of topics roughly equating 5 stations and some feedback is given
      during that 1 hour.</p>
  </div>

  <button class="accordion">Can I have specific questions to practice?</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>If theres some specific questions/areas you would like to work on, let us know prior to the interview. We will
      then try to work on giving you a more personalised experience.
      However the stations we do provide do cover the majority of MMI stations / traditional questions that may arise
      from medical schools.</p>
  </div>

  <button class="accordion">Am I graded?</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>During each session, the interviews will be constantly making notes. In these notes, we will create an electric
      document from each interviewer for you, so you can see what score you would have received for each station and
      some feedback from each station too.</p>
  </div>

  <button class="accordion">I scored low on your grading system. Does this mean Ill fail my real medical
    interview?</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>Interviews can be subjective. We try and provide a realistic score and feedback based off our experience from the
      medical interviews and interviewers themselves. Scoring low does not mean you will do bad on the day. If you did
      score poor from us, use the feedback from us and it will point you in the right direction, so come interview day,
      you're ready to nail it!</p>
  </div>

  <button class="accordion">What happens if i'm late to my mock interview service?</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>Remember the interviewers have lives too and are at medical school so please bear that in mind and try not to be
      late! The session is booked for an hour from the time allocated so if you are late, we will not be running
      overtime for you.</p>
  </div>

  <button class="accordion">Can I cancel and move my interview service?</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>We offer a 12 hour cancellation window prior to your mock interview. If you want to move your interview day to
      another date, please try and do it 12 hours prior to the interview session so we can arrange another date for you.
      We cannot arrange another session if its sooner than 12 hours.
      If you feel after paying that you dont want the mock interview anymore, contact us at themedicalgeeks@gmail.com
      and we'll offer a refund as long as its before 12 hours of the allocated mock interview.</p>

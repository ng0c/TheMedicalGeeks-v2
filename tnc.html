            <ol>
              <li>You may save, copy or print any of our material on the website for your personal use, only if the
                information used is referenced as TheMedicalGeeks.</li>
              <li>You may share the link of the website, or any information of the website with others. This has to
                comply
                with 1.1.</li>
              <li>None of the paid-for guides and services may be shared with others without explicit and clear
                permission
                from us. This permission will be detailed explaining what may/may not be shared.</li>
              <li>No information from our website may be used for teaching, tutoring or guidance sessions, unless a
                permission from us is obtained prior. Whenever our services are used, it must be clearly referenced to
                TheMedicalGeeks.</li>
              <li>The information on this website may not be used to generate income of any kind, and must not be used
                to

                connected with any business, unless given explicit and detailed permission.</li>
              <li>All the content of our website, unless explicitly stated, including but not limited to our logos,

                be given at least a 12-hour notice.</li>
              <li>Refunds for electronic products are not available as it is difficult for us to withdraw our electronic
                products (eg guides) after providing them. This may, therefore, lead to improper use.</li>
              <li>All rights are preserved unless granted, clearly and explicitly.</li>

            <h3>2. Liability</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>Information provided on this website, including guides, services and links to external websites are
                for
                guidance only. It is up to you how you use this information, and it is, therefore, at your own risk how
                you use them.</li>
              <li>TheMedicalGeeks is, to the extent permissible by law, expressly excluded from any responsibility to
                any
                damage, however arising, caused by using this website or any of our services or links included in our
                website. This applies to all affiliations of TheMedicalGeeks.</li>
              <li>In short, TheMedicalGeeks is purely an advisory service and we cannot be held liable, or accountable,
                to
                any unsuccessful outcomes in admissions tests or interviews, or any other point of the application.</li>
              <li>In addition, the content and information on our website is the opinion of its authors
                (TheMedicalGeeks).
                Therefore, this information and content on our website is unofficial, and must only be used for
                guidance.

                do not actively keep any financial information in any kind of database).</li>
              <li>For our own use, we may retain certain information about you such as your name, the services you
                purchased and any comments you left for us. This is so that we can provide you with the best service
                possible if you ask for our services again in the future.</li>
              <li>If you would like a copy of your personal records that we hold of you we are happy to provide that.
                Simply, send us an email (check our email address on website) and we will send you the information ASAP.
                This will cost a simple administrative fee of Â£7.</li>
              <li>If you would like us to delete any of your records that we hold, or all of it, then simply email us
                (check our email address on website) and we will respect your wishes and delete your information
                immediately. This is free of charge.</li>

              <li>If for any reason any cancellation was caused byTheMedicalGeeks, full refund will be offered to any
                affected customers, and alternative arrangements will be made.</li>
